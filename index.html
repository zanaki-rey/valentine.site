Dear Reo, Hindi ko man to sinasabi araw-araw pero you really mean so much to me. I love you because you put effort into loving me, I haven’t experienced a love so calm not until I you. I will always be grateful that you came into my life, you are the best thing that happened to me in 2025. I will never forget the day I talked to you, March 31, 2025 and the day we became together June 21, 2025. I messaged you because a friend dared to do it, but I never knew that a simple dare would lead us here. I will always cherish every moment with you, you make my life easier to live. Sometimes I wonder what I did to deserve you, to deserve your love. Not a single day goes by when I don’t spend time thinking about you. There’s nothing I can write to fully express how you mean so much to me. I never thought someone could feel so much like home or make all my problems disappear until nakilala kita. I can’t wait to be able to hug you, take cute pics with you, eat in a picnic with you and do everything with you. I want to support you and cheer you on 4ever, together or not. Let’s be each other’s safe place and face any problem together because it’s me + you vs the problem, not me vs you. I love you baby and I will love you forevermore.
